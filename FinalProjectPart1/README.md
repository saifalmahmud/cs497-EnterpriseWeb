Sprint: 1
Saif Al Mahmud
CS 497

In this sprint, I have installed the Visual Studio for mac. Went through several tutorials. I am pretty new with the C# as a language. I have done some smaller programs in C# learning from the tutorials.

For the submission of Sprint 1 I have started using the ASP.net core template for MVC and changed the pages to write some static htmls.
